        God is good (all the time)
        And all the time (God is good)

        God is good (all the time)
        And all the time (God is good)

        God is good all the time
        He put a song of praise in this heart of mine
        God is good, yes He is, all the time
        Through the darkest night, His light will shine
        God is good, yes he is, God is good
        All the time, here we go!

        God is good all the time
        He put a song of praise in this heart of mine
        God is good all the time
        Through the darkest night, His light will shine
        God is good, yes, God is good all the time

        That's right, listen
        If you're walking through the valley
        And there are shadows all around
        Do not fear, He will guide you

        He will keep you safe and sound
        He has promised to never leave you
        Or forsake you, and His word is true

        God is good all the time
        He put a song of praise in the heart of mine
        God is good all the time
        Through the darkest night, His light will shine
        God is good, God is good all the time, yes He is

        Listen
        We were sinners and so unworthy
        Still for us He chose to die
        Filled us with His Holy Spirit

        Now we can stand and testify
        That His love is everlasting
        And His mercies, they will never end

        God is good all the time
        He put a song of praise in this heart of mine
        God is good all the time
        Through the darkest night, His light will shine
        God is good, God is good all the time, yes He is

        Though I may not understand
        All the plans you have for me
        My life is in your hands
        And through the eyes of faith I can clearly see

        That God is good all the time
        He put a song of praise in this heart of mine
        God is good all the time
        Through the darkest night, His light will shine
        God is good, God is good all the time

        God is good all the time
        He put a song of praise in the heart of mine
        God is good all the time
        Through the darkest night, His light will shine
        God is good, God is good
        God is good, He's so good, He's so good
        God is good
        He's so good, help me out!
        All the time

        Yes He is!

        God is good (all the time)
        And all the time (God is good)

        God is good (all the time)
        And all the time (God is good)
